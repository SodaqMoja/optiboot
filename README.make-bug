In case you're on a Linux system (who isn't?) and if that system
has GNU make 3.81 (or 3.82) installed you'll be running into a
bug of GNU make.

The bug is that "conditional variable assigment" gives corrupted
text if the variable is also set on the commandline.  Try it for
yourself with this Makefile
	test: var ?= foo

	test:
		echo $(var)
Run the command "make var=hello".  If it echoes 
	echo hello
	hello
then you're alright.  If you see strange characters, you need a
newer version of make.

The bug was solved somewhere in 2010, but in 2013 still most Linux
systems were still using make 3.81.  Strangely enough the bug is not
present on MacOS (or Windows), although it is the same version.

And there another note about this bug.  Originally it was reported
on Savannah as bug #31743.  But Savannah was compromised and that
bug report got lost.  Today bug #31743 is about something else.
