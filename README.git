The git repository was created as a converted clone from
the Mercurial repository at code.google.com

The steps to create the clone were:

$ hg clone https://code.google.com/p/optiboot/
$ mv optiboot optiboot-hg
$ mkdir optiboot
$ cd optiboot
$ git init .
$ hg-fast-export -r ../optiboot-hg/

That's it really.
